**Doc-as-code to share**
Some of data engineering tools I use as daily basic: Dbt, Apache Airflow. 

Some data crawling projects using Scrapy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, PyQuery

Or how I created data point checker app, send message to Lark, using AWS SAM CLI, AWS Lambda based on CDC concept.

Furthermore, the CDC (Change Data Capture) is an interesting concept for data transparentcy and accuracy troubleshooting that I decided to do a deeper research in CDC tools and methods to implement in other cloud platforms such as GCP, AWS, And Microsoft SQL Server 

Hope it can be helpful. Happy Learning!
